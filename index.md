# George Orwell's (Covert) Networks

Since the millennial turn, access to new archives has invigorated scholarship into the ‘cultural Cold War’, but archival information silos and the conflict’s global scope prevent researchers from viewing large-scale networks and relationships. **Mapping the Cultural/Intelligence Nexus** will link archival authority records to display relational information about figures and agencies within covert propaganda networks.

Associates and targets of the novelist George Orwell make up this proof-of-concept case study. 

Using [Encoded Archival Context–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF)](https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/), we aim to connect local record instances with archival repositories, allowing researchers to discover network connections and heritage materials related to state-sponsored cultural activities in WWII and the Cold War period.
