Since the millennial turn, access to new archives has invigorated scholarship into the ‘cultural Cold War’, but archival information silos and the conflict’s global scope prevent researchers from viewing large-scale networks and relationships. **Mapping the Cultural/Intelligence Nexus** will link archival authority records to display relational information about figures and agencies within covert propaganda networks. 

Using [Encoded Archival Context–Corporate Bodies, Persons, and Families (EAC-CPF)](https://eac.staatsbibliothek-berlin.de/), we aim to connect local record instances with archival repositories, allowing researchers to discover network connections and heritage materials related to state-sponsored cultural activities in WWII and the Cold War period. 

The project will bring together expert researchers and archivists to create linked archival records relating to the cultural Cold War. 

George Orwell is the central node of this demo. We map here some of Orwell's known contacts and associates, as well as some of the people he so famously denounced to the Information Research Department (IRD) in 1949.
